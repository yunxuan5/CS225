# Team Contract

## Communication
1. **Team Meetings** Our team will meet in person once a week every Thursday afternoon to discuss the work distribution and development progress of our project. Each team member will rotate to be the note taker. Notes will be stored on the note taker's computer, and will be sent to the other two members via email if necessary. The note taker will integrate the contents of the notes into the development log.

2. **Assistance** Each team member should be available through email, text or social media apps. Outside of emergencies or other commitments, we commit to responding to messages within 24 hours.

3. **Respect** All team members should be respectful to each other and each other's ideas, no matter if one personally agrees with them or not. There will be no 'team leader'. An idea will be adopted if more than half of the team (more than 1 person) are in favor of it, but unanimous agreement is preferred. Every team member will have the opportunity to state their perspective on any topic related to the development of the project. By signing this document, each member of the team commits to adhering to the decisions made.

## Collaboration

1. **Work Distribution** During the team meeting each week, all team members will discuss over the division of work. As long as all team members agree on the fairness of the work division, the work will be divided into three parts, and it should not be changed during the rest of the week except if there is a case of emergency. Each team member will then pick a part to work on. If anyone does not pick any part, the parts will be randomly distributed to all team members.

2. **Time Commitment** All team members are expected to be able to complete their work as distributed according to the development log. If anyone ends up working more than 6 hours per week on their part, the other members should share some of the workload. Minimum time commitment on the project is not required, but each team member should allocate a reasonable amount of time for working on the project.

If a team member is habitually not completing their tasks, they may be asked – politely – to explain their circumstances. Based on their explanation further actions, such as alerting a staff member, may be taken on a case by case basis decided by the other team members.

3. **Conflict Resolution** In case of a conflict, the team members should try to objectively analyze all possible decisions using available resources(Google, books, etc) and find the best solution. Should the conflict remain unresolved, it will be decided by a flip of a coin.
