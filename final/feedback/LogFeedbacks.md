## March 28
Incomplete (100%). Actual log did not get pushed until Apr 6, so for the week of Mar 28 - Apr 3 the development log is missing. However, we allow for 1 week of missing log without 
penalty, so you should be fine as long as you remember to update it every following week. 

## Apr 4
Sophisticated (100%). Description of progress is clear, keep up the good work.
